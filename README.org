#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The way the mind functions provides a further proof.  A being can be
grasped by an act of simple understanding, and in such a case the
thing which is true is known. But the truth value itself is known only
by an act of judgment.  Simple understanding, however, precedes an act
of judgment -- John Duns Scotus, Concerning Human Knowledge
